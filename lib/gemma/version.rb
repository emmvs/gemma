# Semantic versioning follows a specific pattern: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.

# MAJOR: Incremented when you make incompatible API changes.
# MINOR: Incremented when you add functionality in a backward-compatible manner.
# PATCH: Incremented when you make backward-compatible bug fixes.
# Based on your question:

# 0.1.1: This indicates a patch release. It means you made backward-compatible bug fixes or minor enhancements that don't affect the existing functionality
# 1.0.0: This would be a major release. You'd increment the MAJOR version when you introduce backward-incompatible changes or significant new features
# 1.1.0: This would be a minor release. You'd increment the MINOR version when you add new functionality in a backward-compatible manner
# 0.1.2: This would be another patch release, indicating backward-compatible bug fixes or minor enhancements
